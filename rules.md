# Adding a new entry

Format your paper as the following:

| Dataset | Paper | 
| -- | -- | 
| GLUE | Best data augmentation technique [(ACL '27)](https://github.com/styfeng/DataAug4NLP/) [code](https://github.com/styfeng/DataAug4NLP/) | 

Specifically:

- Only include the title of the paper.
- Only capitalize the first word in the title. 
- Include the conference in parenthesis, with a link to the paper. Use ACL Anthology if possible. Abbreviate if it's a workshop paper. 
- Use '27 instead of 2027. 
- Include the code if you have it.
- Add the papers chronologically. 

The only exception to this format is if your paper title is not about data augmentation, but it is well-known for doing data augmentation. 
This should follow the first example under text classification called `Synonym Replacement`.  

## Note from authors to authors 
The purpose of this repo is to clarify the landscape of data aug techniques in NLP. This can get muddied with promoting our own work.
Thus, to disentangle the two, I think we should list work that includes any of the authors in a section at the very end. 
This will let readers know that we have not sorted the papers in such a way that our own work is prioritized.
